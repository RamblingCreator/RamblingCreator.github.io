          <h1>My game</h1>
          <p> I'm currently working on making a game using Unity. My initial idea was just something involving gathering plants to make potions, but when I actually started making the game I developed the idea out more. I've added procedurally generating plants and a simple alchemy system, as well as basic features like an inventory. I'm currently working on upgrading the visuals, implementing saving and loading, expanding the world, and fixing bugs. It's still a work in progress, but I've done a lot of work on it. </p>
