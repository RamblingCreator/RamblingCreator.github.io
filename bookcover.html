        <h1>Book Cover</h1>
        <p>I made this as a gift for a friend of mine. He's an author, and I recreated the cover of <a href="https://kmalexander.com/my-books/the-bell-forging-cycle/the-stars-were-right/">one of his books</a> out of leather. I worked on it intermittently for about a year. </p>
