            <h3>Ideas</h3>
            <p>My plan was to make armor for a stuffed kiwi, and I decided that I wanted to make a leather helmet, gambeson-like jacket, and pants.
              These are the images that i used as inspiration for the design.
              I knew that I wanted the pants to be black, and that the helmet would be brown, but I didnâ€™t decide the color of the jacket until I was looking at the fabric options.</p>

          <div class="slide-text">
            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p> It was difficult to create the pattern. I had to create a pair of pants for something that was always sitting down, with strange proportions. I also had to figure out how to make a jacket for something without arms, but that wasn't quite as difficult. </p>

            <h3>Patterning</h3>
            <p>This is the pattern for the jacket. I used it to draft the lines for the quilting on the final piece. <br>
              I cut out 2 of this piece from green fabric, and 1 from a thicker fabric</p>

            <h3>Sewing</h3>
            <p>First, I sewed the pieces into a pocket, so that the thicker piece would be on the inside when it was turned inside out
              Next, I closed the final seam of the pocket so that I had 1 piece of material with the thicker part sandwiched between the green pieces.</p>

          <div class="slide-text">
            <h3>Finishing</h3>
            <p> I drew evenly spaced diagonal lines to guide where I was going to sew to quilt it. Then, I sewed along all these lines to create the quilted effect, then trimmed the loose threads from the ends. Last, I attached a hook and eye closure to the jacket so that it would be wearable.</p>

            <h3>Patterning</h3>
            <p> This is the pattern for the pants. The crumpled versions are the ones that I pinned to the stuffed animal so that I could test it. I cut 2 of each piece out. </p>

            <h3>Sewing</h3>
            <p>This picture is from when I was partway through sewing the pants pieces together. I had hemmed some of the edges and sewn together the outside seam on one half of the pants.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Finishing</h3>
            <p> After finishing the outside seams, I sewed the 2 halves to each other and hemmed the final edge. Next, I sewed the top leg seams.
              This picture was taken at this point. I noticed that the waistband stuck really far out to the back, so I also folded and sewed the back seam in so it would fit better. </p>

            <h3>Patterning</h3>
            <p>The first step was drafting the pattern. I made 5 total pieces: the beak, main head section, and 3 back segments. I cut these pieces out of leather, then punched the holes for riveting and sewing.</p>

            <h3>Finishing</h3>
            <p> I used a piece of cardboard to form the beak into a curved shape.
              Finally, I dyed the pieces using brown dye, then sewed & riveted them together.
              I needed to sew the beak to the main section and rivet the back pieces to the main section. </p>
